WHAT MAKES A GREAT TEST: \
A great test covers behavior users depend on. It tests a feature that, if broken, would frustrate or block users. \
It validates real workflows — not implementation details. It catches regressions before users do. \
Do NOT write tests just to increase coverage. Use coverage as a guide to find UNTESTED USER-FACING BEHAVIOR. \
If uncovered code is not worth testing (boilerplate, unreachable error branches, internal plumbing), \
add /* v8 ignore next / or / v8 ignore start */ comments instead of writing low-value tests. \
PROCESS: \
Run uv run coverage run -m pytest to see which files have low coverage. \
Read the uncovered lines and identify the most important USER-FACING FEATURE that lacks tests. \
Prioritize: error handling users will hit, CLI commands, file parsing. \
Deprioritize: internal utilities, edge cases users won't encounter, boilerplate. \
Write ONE meaningful test that validates the feature works correctly for users. \
Run uv run coverage report to see updated coverage. \
Commit with message: test(<file>): <describe the user behavior being tested> \
Append super-concise notes to test-coverage-progress.txt: what you tested, coverage %, any learnings. \

ONLY WRITE ONE TEST PER ITERATION. \
If statement coverage reaches 100%, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>. \
