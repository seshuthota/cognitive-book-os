# Test Coverage Progress v2

## Iteration 1
- **Tested**: brain.py get_objective() - user retrieves their original query from a brain
- **Coverage**: 92% (68 missing lines, was 72)
- **Learning**: get_objective() parses markdown to extract just the user's question text

## Iteration 2
- **Tested**: brain.py get_response()/update_response() - user retrieves synthesized answer after ingestion
- **Coverage**: 93% (66 missing lines, was 68)
- **Learning**: Response starts with placeholder, then system updates with synthesized answer
